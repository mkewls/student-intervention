   "source": [
    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "(1) Decision Trees: A novel, but useful application for decision trees is its use in sleep analytic software, specifically mobile apps that use phone sensors to track a range of variables about a person's sleep -- features -- and apply labels to train and predict sleep quality. Decision trees are strong for a variety of reasons, but especially when data preparation costs must remain low, visual interpretation is at a premium, and observation of the learning logic is desired. It likewise performs well with mixed data (categorical & numerical), so long as basic steps are taken to normalize or dummify the data, and in situations where multiple outputs are expected. As for weaknesses, it is prone to overfitting if the tree logic goes to deep and can be highly sensitive to small variations in the data or unbalanced data in terms of bias. Consequently, it performs poorly when there are many branches to discern in building the model and in cases where developing thresholds for a decision branch is difficult or too uncertain to reliably establish the branching in the model. I decided to choose this model because our data types play to the strength of the model, because we can statistically test the model results based on the data, and because we can easily observe how the model is learning (which I think is a big advantage!).\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) SVM: There is a wide breadth of application for SVM's in the real-world, but a major one is risk prediction, e.g., credit risk, given the common business case of using SVM's for inductive inference (i.e., inferring from features of a group of known low credit risk borrowers whether an unknown group of borrowers are low risk as well based on their features). SVM's are good at high dimensionality data, given the ability to find hyperplanes in a many dimensional space using the kernel trick, but accordingly, it rarely works well with a low quantity of data (we're likely safe here given that there are 8x as many samples to work with than features). Another disadvantage related to the data is that the large size needed may require longer computational times, although subset calculations (choice of kernel function) are potential speed-ups and memory savers. As mentioned, the samples outnumbering features is a good thing for the data we have here, but more importantly, I think inductive inference is going to work well in making predictions about \"high risk\" students based on learning features from known failing students.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Ensemble Methods: The same real-world applications for SVM's and Decision Trees (hello, Random Forests) can apply to those of ensemble methods. Simplisticly, ensemble methods can improve the bias or variance problems of \"regular\" learners by introducing randomness, sampling, averaging, and other techniques. Netflix's recommendation system, at least at one point, was a good real-world example of using ensemble methods. An advantage, as mentioned, is that they average out bias, reduce noise and thus variance, and given this, are unlikely to overfit. A disadvantage is the relative inability to use these methods in producing probabilities (as opposed to classification). Additionally, if a particular ensemble method is applied to the wrong data model, e.g., bagging a high-bias model, the results will not be good. I'd like to try to Random Forests for this data set, both because I believe it will produce a good classification as a tree-based learning model, but also as a comparison to a \"pure\" decision tree model (my first model)."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Based on the experiments we conducted, the Support Vector Classification (SVC) model clearly bested other tested models in our primary concern, that being the minimization of false positives and potentially more importantly, false negatives (derived from our F1 score). Secondarily, the SVC model was comparable to the other tested models in terms of both training and prediction time using the available data size, thereby making it resource and cost efficient when considering any of those models for use in this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, our best performance (F1 score) was obtained using the SVC with a smaller training set size (100 vs. 200 or 300), producing a harmonic mean of precision and recall near to 0.85. That not only bested its own performance with other training set sizes, but all training set sizes of the other two models by over 0.12 (12% better). At this training set size, the SVC trains at 1.0ms and predicts at 0.6ms, which provide a speed suited for not only quick batching of results, but even real-time predictions through a developed interface for the model. Interestingly, that means that the SVC handles the high-dimensionality well, but also does best with only 2x as many samples as features. The strong advantage of inductive inference still wins the day and provides a clear use case for SVC here."

What we've been able to do is develop a model that minimizes these undesireable outcomes. Our combined false positives (identifying someone as not going to graduate incorrectly) and false negatives (identifying someone as going to graduate incorrectly) are reduced by using everything we know about those who do pass (including whether or not they lack something) to compare those same things in students we wish to make an intervention decision about.

    "**Answer: **  The tuned model's F1 score for training and testing are 0.8056 and 0.8163, respectively. This is using a fairly wide scope of hyperparameter values in an exhaustive grid search, and reflects the best tuning of parameter values over repeated experimentation (i.e., many other values were tested within those hyperparameters, but excluded in the above code, as they did not raise the score). In the end, the tuning functions did not produce close to the untuned model's F1 score (0.8481) despite including the same hyperparameter values as part of the grid search. The calculations done by grid search under the hood to improve accuracy (in addition to the provided F1 scorer) are the likely culprit for that discrepancy. In addition, in reviewing sklearn's great documentation on grid search, it seems that tuning the hyperparameters (e.g., C, kernel, gamma) does not produce improvements through an exhaustive grid search when the problem solved by the model is too easy. That may be the case in this instance given the small application of data to train the model (generalizes well to the test data using a training data of only 100 samples)."
