    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "(1) Decision Trees: A novel, but useful application for decision trees is its use in sleep analytic software, specifically mobile apps that use phone sensors to track a range of variables about a person's sleep -- features -- and apply labels to train and predict sleep quality. Decision trees are strong for a variety of reasons, but especially when data preparation costs must remain low, visual interpretation is at a premium, and observation of the learning logic is desired. It likewise performs well with mixed data (categorical & numerical), so long as basic steps are taken to normalize or dummify the data, and in situations where multiple outputs are expected. As for weaknesses, it is prone to overfitting if the tree logic goes to deep and can be highly sensitive to small variations in the data or unbalanced data in terms of bias. Consequently, it performs poorly when there are many branches to discern in building the model and in cases where developing thresholds for a decision branch is difficult or too uncertain to reliably establish the branching in the model. I decided to choose this model because our data types play to the strength of the model, because we can statistically test the model results based on the data, and because we can easily observe how the model is learning (which I think is a big advantage!).\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) SVM: There is a wide breadth of application for SVM's in the real-world, but a major one is risk prediction, e.g., credit risk, given the common business case of using SVM's for inductive inference (i.e., inferring from features of a group of known low credit risk borrowers whether an unknown group of borrowers are low risk as well based on their features). SVM's are good at high dimensionality data, given the ability to find hyperplanes in a many dimensional space using the kernel trick, but accordingly, it rarely works well with a low quantity of data (we're likely safe here given that there are 8x as many samples to work with than features). Another disadvantage related to the data is that the large size needed may require longer computational times, although subset calculations (choice of kernel function) are potential speed-ups and memory savers. As mentioned, the samples outnumbering features is a good thing for the data we have here, but more importantly, I think inductive inference is going to work well in making predictions about \"high risk\" students based on learning features from known failing students.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Ensemble Methods: The same real-world applications for SVM's and Decision Trees can apply to those of ensemble methods. Simplisticly, ensemble methods can improve the bias or variance problems of \"regular\" learners by introducing randomness, sampling, averaging, and other techniques. Netflix's recommendation system, at least at one point, was a good real-world example of using ensemble methods. For the purpose of this project, I'll be choosing the Random Forests ensemble method. Random Forests shares many of the advantages of Decision Trees, such as its ability to perform well without much preparation of the data, but also extends the power of Decision Trees by elevating feature importance for each random sub-set of the data it cycles through, instead of getting stuck on a single feature rank for the entire data set. Likewise, while this can increase model bias as compared to a single non-random Decision tree model, variance will be reduced and thus help to avoid overfitting and improve performance over Decision Trees. Unfortunately, for the improvement gained by using Random Forests, there is a loss of a big Decision Tree advantage, namely clarity in how the model is learning, which as stated above can be a big reason why one would choose a Decision Tree model in the first place. For this data set, it will be interesting to see if Random Forests outperform the single Decision Tree model. "

    "**Answer: ** Based on the experiments we conducted, the Support Vector Classification (SVC) model clearly bested other tested models in our primary concern, that being the minimization of false positives and potentially more importantly, false negatives (derived from our F1 score). Secondarily, the SVC model was comparable to the other tested models in terms of both training and prediction time using the available data size, thereby making it resource and cost efficient when considering any of those models for use in this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, our best performance (F1 score) was obtained using the SVC with a smaller training set size (100 vs. 200 or 300), producing a harmonic mean of precision and recall near to 0.85. That not only bested its own performance with other training set sizes, but all training set sizes of the other two models by over 0.12 (12% better). At this training set size, the SVC trains at 1.0ms and predicts at 0.6ms, which provide a speed suited for not only quick batching of results, but even real-time predictions through a developed interface for the model. Interestingly, that means that the SVC handles the high-dimensionality well, but also does best with only 2x as many samples as features. The strong advantage of inductive inference still wins the day and provides a clear use case for SVC here."

    "**Answer: **  To make our predictions, we've chosen a Support Vector Classification model, which is a type of Support Vector Machine. Although the name is a bit opaque, it can be thought of as a chart with all the students we use to train the model plotted on it. Now this chart is multi-dimensional, and well beyond just a two-dimensional 'x' and 'y' chart. Indeed, there is a dimension for each feature we add, so in this case, with 30 features for each student, it's a 30-dimensional chart! Best not to try to visualize that one. What's important here is knowing that an SVM can make this plot and better yet, can create a decision line that captures which students failed and which passed from the training set. Ideally, this is a perfect capturing, but in reality some who failed end up on the passing side and vice-versa. You may have realized that creating this line in a 30-dimensional space may look a bit weird, for instance, what if our plot of passing students are enclosed by our plot of failing students. How would that line work? Well, there's a mathematical trick the SVM uses to move up to the next higher dimension to create its line, thus allowing it to cut through the two groups. We can visualize this as changing our perspective on the plotted points, looking at it from the side instead of straight-on. When we do that, we see that even though the failing students are enclosing the passing ones, they are all to the left side when we changed our perspective (i.e., went to a higher dimension). So, we can make our line between the students from this perspective and use that in making our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the prediction part of the model, which is of course, the big value we're producing for our student intervention decisions. Since we now have our decision line, we can start adding new students to the chart. These students will fall on either one side of the decision line or the other. In our quick example above, if the student is on the left side of the line, we will predict that the added student is at risk of failing and we'll include them in our intervention program. Isn't math great? "

    "**Answer: **  The tuned model's F1 score for training and testing are 0.8056 and 0.8163, respectively. This is using a fairly wide scope of hyperparameter values in an exhaustive grid search, and reflects the best tuning of parameter values over repeated experimentation (i.e., many other values were tested within those hyperparameters, but excluded in the above code, as they did not raise the score). In the end, the tuning functions did not produce close to the untuned model's F1 score (0.8481) despite including the same hyperparameter values as part of the grid search. The calculations done by grid search under the hood to improve accuracy (in addition to the provided F1 scorer) are the likely culprit for that discrepancy. In addition, in reviewing sklearn's great documentation on grid search, it seems that tuning the hyperparameters (e.g., C, kernel, gamma) does not produce improvements through an exhaustive grid search when the problem solved by the model is too easy. That may be the case in this instance given the small application of data to train the model (generalizes well to the test data using a training data of only 100 samples)."
